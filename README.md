Repository for the supplementary code of the paper 'Data-based stochastic modeling of tree growth and structure formation' in Silva Fennica, 2015.
The paper offers a novel approach to model structure of trees by iteratively optimizing empirical distributions describing structure of the data tree (as obtained from the laser scanning) and those of a model (here stochastic LIGNUM). The resulting stochastic model has 'optimal' parameters producing statistically similar trees, BUT not exact copies of each other.
