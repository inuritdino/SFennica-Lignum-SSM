1.1.1: Scatter output patch:
i) Avoid and warn on NaN values.
ii) NaN are not reported (this causes problems in the subsequent Bayes Forest scatter analysis).
iii) Scatters for the trunk (taper and curvature only).
iv) Poisson shedding infinite loop security code.

1.1: Shedding options:
i) delayed production of buds that are not allowed to grow due to (radiation) conditions.
ii) shedding year: year requirement on the youngest segment in the branch to shed.
iii) Random number of segment from the tip to shed: uniform and Poisson distributions.

1.0: Full version, ready to run, with several parameter sets 
and all features of LIGNUM as of publications Perttunen et al. 1998,
Sievanen et al. 2008, except for the radiation conditions, which are taken from
Palubicki et al., 2009.
